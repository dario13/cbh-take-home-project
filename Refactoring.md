# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

In the refactored version, I introduced several helper functions (hashData, ensureIsString, and truncateToMaxLength) to break down the logic into smaller, easy-to-understand parts. This improves readability by making the code more modular and easier to understand. Additionally, I used meaningful function names that clearly describe their purpose. This helps devs quickly know the code's intent without having to analyze every line of code in detail. I also added JSDoc comments for each function, providing a description of their purpose, input parameters, and return value. This makes it even easier to read by giving a quick idea of what each function does. Finally, I simplified the main deterministicPartitionKey function by removing nested conditionals and combining the assignment of 'candidate' with the ternary operator. These changes make the code more concise and easier to follow. Overall, the refactored version is more readable because it is better organized, more modular, and well documented.
